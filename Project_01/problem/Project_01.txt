Perfect ‚Äî this is exactly the right approach üëè
Below is your SOHO Network Design Project written as a realistic problem statement, the way you‚Äôd find in professional labs or case studies. You can use this to design and implement your own solution in Cisco Packet Tracer or GNS3.

üß© Project Title:

Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) Network Design and Implementation

üìÑ Problem Statement:

A small company named TechCore Solutions has recently set up a new office with around 25 employees working across different departments. They have requested a secure, scalable, and cost-effective network to support their daily operations such as file sharing, internet access, and inter-department communication.

As the Network Engineer, you have been assigned to design and configure the entire internal network using Cisco devices.

üéØ Project Requirements / Objectives:
1. Network Topology:

One router (to connect to the Internet Service Provider).

Two switches (to connect all departments).

Four VLANs representing the following departments:

VLAN 10 ‚Äì Administration (5 users)

VLAN 20 ‚Äì HR (5 users)

VLAN 30 ‚Äì IT (10 users)

VLAN 40 ‚Äì Guest Wi-Fi (5 users)

2. IP Addressing:

Use the network: 192.168.10.0/24

Subnet and allocate IPs for each VLAN.

Assign gateway IPs for each VLAN interface on the router.

3. Routing:

Configure Router-on-a-Stick for inter-VLAN routing.

Ensure all VLANs can communicate with each other except Guest VLAN, which should have internet-only access.

4. DHCP Configuration:

Configure DHCP pools on the router to automatically assign IP addresses to each VLAN.

Exclude gateway and static device IPs from the DHCP range.

5. NAT Configuration:

Simulate internet connectivity using NAT (overload or PAT).

Only internal users should be able to access the internet using NAT.

6. Security:

Configure ACLs to block Guest VLAN (VLAN 40) from accessing internal VLANs (10, 20, 30).

Allow Guest VLAN to access the internet only.

7. Testing & Verification:

Verify inter-VLAN communication (Admin ‚Üî HR ‚Üî IT).

Verify that Guest VLAN users can access the internet but not internal departments.

Test DHCP address allocation for each VLAN.

Confirm NAT functionality for internet access.

üß† Deliverables:

You need to submit or document:

Network Topology Diagram (made in Cisco Packet Tracer or drawn separately).

IP Addressing Table for all VLANs.

Configuration commands (for router and switches).

Verification screenshots (ping, show commands, DHCP leases, ACLs).

Brief report explaining how the design meets the company‚Äôs requirements.

üíº Expected Learning Outcomes:

VLAN design and segmentation

Router-on-a-stick inter-VLAN routing

DHCP & NAT configuration on routers

ACL-based network security

End-to-end network verification and documentation

Would you like me to create a sample topology diagram + IP plan for this same problem so you can start configuring it directly in Packet Tracer?
(It‚Äôll include device names, port numbers, VLAN IDs, and IP ranges.)
